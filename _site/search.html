Get a full Home SearchSelling your Louisville home? Get a free Home Value ReportWe’re coming to you today from a great home here on Duker Street. This property has an awesome story behind it that we’d like to share with you today.The owner of the property was a really nice lady who once gave us a call because she needed help: She didn’t know if she wanted to list the house on the market or sell it outright. Of course, the Dream J.P. Pirtle Realtors team always offers our sellers both options.“Right now is a great time to sell your home.”In the end, she didn’t want to list the home, so we ended up buying it from her. We were actually able to give her a lot more for it than she had even asked for in the first place, which made her very happy. This Duker Street home is in a great area right across from a school, and (even in the video above) you can even hear how happy the children here are. We may decide to rent it out, but that decision isn’t final. If you’d like to learn more about it, feel free to contact us!The moral of this story is that right now is a great time to sell your home—our spring inventory is very low, which means your home is in high demand, and interest rates are still historically low as well, meaning you’ll probably get more money for your home this year than you would have in any of the previous 10 years. The market is hot.If you need advice about selling your home or would like us to do a no-obligation, free comparative market analysis to help you find out what your home would be worth, reach out to us. We can either help you list your home on the market or make you an offer for it ourselves. I hope to hear from you soon!",

        "content": "The latest news from our Louisville area market is here, so let’s review some of the most significant ways things have changed since last year.Buying a Louisville home? Get a full Home SearchSelling your Louisville home? Get a free Home Value ReportThe weather is getting warm out there, and our real estate market is heating up, too. To demonstrate this, let’s review some year-over-year statistics from March of 2018 versus March of 2019.In March of 2018, 1,429 homes sold in our local market. This March, that number dropped down to 1,361. This may not be a significant change, but it does reflect some of the other developments we’ve observed—namely, the increases in inventory and average sales price.Inventory rose over this same 12-month period from 2.3 months’ worth of supply to about 2.45 months’ worth, leaving us with 3,500 active listings in March 2018 and 3,600 in March of this year. The average sales price, meanwhile, rose from $208,035 to $217,619.“There are plenty of opportunities in our Louisville market right now, regardless of your real estate goals.”Likely as a result of these changes, the average number of days that listings spent on the market in March also changed, going from 67 in 2018 to 75 in 2019.Last but not least is the matter of interest rates. Last March, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage in our area was 4.4%. Interestingly enough, the average interest rate this March actually decreased, sitting at 4.33%. This is great news for anyone looking to buy, and our still-low inventory levels indicate favorable conditions for sellers, too.In short, our current market conditions are prime for buyers and sellers alike. There are plenty of opportunities in our Louisville market, regardless of your real estate goals.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "These seven seller tips are sure to make your home sale go off without a hitch.Buying a Louisville home? Get a full Home SearchSelling your Louisville home? Get a free Home Value ReportTo sell your home for the highest possible price and in no time, your selling strategy should be comprised of these seven tips:1. Clean the home top to bottom. Your home should sparkle to the point that eating off the floor doesn’t seem like a bit of a stretch. Buyers will take notice of a home that is spic and span, is freshly painted, and has carpet that looks good as new. “This is sure to earn you a great ROI.”2. Get rid of clutter and personal items. The more clutter that’s strewn about your home, the worse your chances of selling for top dollar are. Removing personal items and clutter will give buyers an unobstructed view of what the future could look like for them and their family in the home. It’ll be hard for them to do that if your family photographs are hanging on the walls.3. Remove large furniture. Big, bulky furniture shrinks your home—at least that’s the way it’ll be perceived. To showcase as much of your home’s square footage as possible, think about relocating bigger items to storage in the meantime. Additionally, the furniture that you leave in the home should look new and fresh, so think about removing dated or ratty-looking furniture as well.“Buyers will take notice of a home that’s spic and span, is freshly painted, and has carpet that looks good as new, and this is sure to earn you a great ROI.”4. Hire a professional real estate team. And yes, I mean “team.” Did you know the average agent in our area sells five homes or less each year? For our part, my team sells 400-plus homes year in and year out. Simply put, it’ll be of great benefit to you to work with a team that has a proven, repeatable system to sell homes. If you needed surgery on your back, would you hire a surgeon that does upward of 20 procedures of this kind per month, or the surgeon that does less than five a month? The answer seems obvious because it is.5. Find a team that can create demand and has a great marketing plan. We spend $300,000 marketing our clients’ homes on a yearly basis, and with us, your home will appear on a TV advertisement two to three times every weekend until it’s sold! Through our digital marketing plan, you can count on us for professional photography and to maximize your home’s exposure on various social media platforms.6. Find a team that has a trade program. Many move-up buyers have a home they need to sell, and if one of these buyers makes a winning offer on your home, we can buy their property for cash.7. Price your home to sell. Your agent’s responsibility isn’t to tell you what you want to hear with regard to your home’s value, it’s to be forthright about what price you should set it at so that you’ll earn top dollar on your home sale.If you plan to buy or sell a home soon or for any advice related to real estate, feel free to give us a call at 502-458-2722. We’d be happy to come out and give you a free market analysis, and we look forward to speaking with you!",

Get a full Home SearchSelling your Louisville home? Get a free Home Value ReportIf you need to buy and sell a home at the same time, that’s a tricky prospect in our current market.Several years ago, we agents could coordinate these two transactions much more easily. Now, things have changed. Two or three years ago, inventory in our market started to shrink. Before that time, we had as much as 15,000 available homes on the market. Now, we have a little over 3,000.In other words, we’re still in a strong seller’s market, which means you need an aggressive, strategic marketing program to get your current home sold quickly. If you work with our team, that shouldn’t be a problem.“Once a home goes live in this market, it’s a challenge to get to it before anyone else.”The real question, though, is what you’re going to do with your next home. Are you upsizing or downsizing? In either case, you need the services of an experienced team with the tools that can help you locate the right home, make an offer on it, and get it under contract before any other buyers know about it. Once a home goes live in this market, it’s a challenge to get to it before anyone else.As far as experience goes, the agent you work with should be a full-time Realtor and be a part of a team that sells roughly 500 homes a year. If you give us a call, we’d be happy to give you a market evaluation and tell you how we can get you to the closing table on both sides of the transaction with the least amount of hassle.If you have any other questions about our market, feel free to reach out to us as well.

        "content": "Contingencies can be a tricky thing to navigate in an offer, especially if they aren’t revealed up front. There are a few key things you need to watch out for.Buying a Louisville home? Get a full Home SearchSelling your Louisville home? Get a free Home Value ReportRecently, sale and closing contingencies are becoming very popular again. A lot of people are afraid to buy before they sell, or vice versa.Unfortunately, some people may not alert you to a contingency within a contract. Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, be sure to read things over carefully and make sure there’s nothing hidden in the fine print that you weren’t told about.One red flag to look out for is an offer with far-off closing dates. People who give themselves a long time to close sometimes do so because they’re hoping they can sell their home during this time, before they buy yours. If they don’t, they can wiggle out of the contract and get their deposit back by having their lender verify that their financing fell through.“Read things over carefully and make sure there’s nothing hidden in the fine print.”Personally, I don’t think this is exactly ethical. I think contingencies should be revealed up front. Since this isn’t always the case, though, be sure to have your agent check over your contract for contingencies. Contingencies absolutely must be in writing.The first writer refusal time frame is also important. If you, as a seller, get another offer within this time frame, the first buyer needs to make a decision about whether to put their offer in writing or not. I personally think 24 hours is plenty of time for this.Lastly, be aware of when inspections start on a contingency offer. My preference is to have inspections completed right away after acceptance, so that the deal can be solidified sooner rather than later.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "Vyral Marketing",

        "content": "Because of the hot competition we’re seeing lately in the market, escalation clauses have become much more common.Buying a Louisville home? Get a full Home SearchSelling your Louisville home? Get a free Home Value ReportRecently, we’ve been seeing a lot of escalation clauses in our market. But, what is in an escalation clause?An escalation clause is a buyer’s best and final offer. People have been making these kinds of offers for years, but recently they have become a lot more important. This is largely thanks to our being in seller’s market where competition is hot.Buyers right now don’t want to lose out on the right home, but they also don’t want to have to make excessively high offers.“Setting a limit will help ensure that a buyer doesn’t pay a ridiculous amount.”An escalation clause allows buyers to stipulate that they will pay up to a certain amount limit in order to beat out other offers. As an example, an escalation clause might state that a buyer will pay up to $1,000 over any other offer that is made.This cap means that buyers don’t need to be as worried about overpaying. Setting a limit will help ensure that a buyer doesn’t pay a ridiculous amount.Buyers must also be careful, though, to compare offers by the net sale price. In your escalation clause, ask to see the best and highest offer.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>I want to thank everyone who bought or sold a home with us in 2015, or anyone who referred us business.</b> You were a huge help in making 2015 our best year ever! The whole Louisville market performed very well, and we managed to sell 30 homes just in December. Throughout the year we managed to help more than 400 families buy and sell homes.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Let's look at 2015 as a whole. <b>The average sales price was $192,000 in 2015, and this is a nice increase from $180,000 in 2014.</b> Nearly 16,500 homes sold in the MLS in 2015, which is almost 2,000 more homes than 2014. Our absorption rate in 2015 was 4.53, which means that the market was balanced and healthy.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>We think that this momentum will continue to push us to new heights in 2016.</b> Interest rates will continue to increase, so we're expecting a lot of buyers to come onto the market. If you're thinking about selling, 2016 is a great year to do so.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Once again, I'd like to thank you for your business and referrals in 2015. We look forward to serving you at a higher level in 2015.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Here's a final quote to close with:</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><i>"There is little success where there is little laughter."</i></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><i>- Andrew Carnegie</i></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><i><br /></i></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>

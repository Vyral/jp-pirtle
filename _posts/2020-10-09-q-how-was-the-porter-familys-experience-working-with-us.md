Today I’m proud to introduce you to the Porter family, our team’s most recent clients, so we can share their testimonial of working with Dream JP Pirtle Realtors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

We met with them one week before the recording of this video after they told us they were interested in selling their property. They wanted to know how much they could sell it for, but they also wanted an as-is offer.

**During our meeting, we put our money where our mouth is.** As with all potential clients, we showed them two net sheets: one showing what they’d walk away with by listing the home on the open market, the other what they’d walk away with if we bought the home from them. In this net sheet, we also showed them our formula for purchasing homes.&nbsp;

We didn’t apply any pressure or give them a hard sell. After a couple of days of deliberation, they called us back saying they wanted to sell outright. All told, we were able to close on their home in less than a week.&nbsp;

Was it a good experience for them? You can skip to 1:36 in the video above to see their full answer, but to paraphrase their response, everything went smoothly and quickly. We did everything we told them we were going to do. Not only did they say they would do everything exactly the same if they could do it all over again, but **they will absolutely refer our company to others.&nbsp;**

I want to thank the Porter family for trusting us with their business and joining me today. I also want to give a shoutout to all our past clients and referrals. If you have any real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’re here to help.

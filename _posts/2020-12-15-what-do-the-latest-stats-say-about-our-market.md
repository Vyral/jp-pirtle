Can you believe we’re more than halfway through December? Now that 2020 is almost over, it’s time for another quick market recap. This time, we’ll compare last month’s numbers to those from November 2019:&nbsp;

**We continue to see a quick, aggressive market here in Louisville and the surrounding areas.** Inventory is low but it hasn’t affected our sales, which is good news. Homes are selling quickly, and the atmosphere is competitive. We’re on track to have one of our best years ever in terms of total closings. In light of everything that’s happened this year, it’s encouraging to see some things stay strong.&nbsp;

We at Dream JP Pirtle Realtors want to take a moment to wish you and your family a merry Christmas. This year things will no doubt look a little different as we maintain social distancing practices, but let’s not forget what this time of year is all about. **We’re thankful for you**; as we’ve said before, if it wasn’t for you—our loyal clients who keep sending us referrals—we wouldn’t be here. You are our business, and we appreciate you very much.&nbsp;

In light of the holiday season, the quote we’ll leave you with this time comes from none other than Dr. Suess: *“Christmas will always be as long as we stand heart to heart and hand in hand.”*

If you ever have any real estate needs, don’t hesitate to give our office a call. We’d love to help you. We’ll see you in 2021\!

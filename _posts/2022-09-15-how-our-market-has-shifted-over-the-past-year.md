Today I’m here to briefly recap what happened in our real estate market in August 2022 and compare it to August 2021.&nbsp;

Let's start with the absorption rate, which is the amount of time it would take a sale to sell a house that's currently listed. In August 2022, the absorption rate was 1.57 months. The absorption rate for August 2021 was 1.34 months. That’s an increase of 17%. This means that things are taking only a little bit longer to sell, but still sell super quickly.

The average listing price for 2021 was $374,985. This year it was $395,777. That’s an increase of 5.5%. The median listing price last year was $250,000. This year it was $289,900. That’s almost a 16% increase, which is good for sellers.

I’m sure you’ve heard that **interest rates are continuing to rise, but you shouldn’t be very worried about them because they are still low compared to the historical average.** If you want to find out what type of great interest rate you can get, call our friends at Statewide Mortgage. They're locally owned and run. It makes a big difference to have them right here in our backyard to give you great information and a top notch experience from beginning to end.

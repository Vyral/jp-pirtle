Those who bought a property even just a year ago have already built plenty of equity—the amount that historically they would have gained in four to five years. Homes are still moving quickly, and it’s an excellent time to buy or sell. Interest rates are still low at about 2.875% for FHA and 3.25% for conventional loans.&nbsp;

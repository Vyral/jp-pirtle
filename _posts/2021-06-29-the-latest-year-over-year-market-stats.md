In general, it’s been a very interesting market. We know things have been scary, but it seems like people are getting more comfortable. Here at Dream JP Pirtle Realtors, we’re still doing weekly training with our agents and bringing in outside vendors to share tips and tricks for handling this market.&nbsp;

If you have questions about these numbers or are curious about becoming an agent yourself, give us a call, visit our website, or check us out on Facebook. We’d love to hear from you.

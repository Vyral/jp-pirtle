What’s changed in our Louisville real estate market since last year? For your latest market update, **let’s compare the stats from this October to those from October 2019:**

What do these stats indicate? **We’re in a strong, competitive seller’s market that’s driving prices up.** Homes are selling incredibly quickly. Even though inventory is lower, we’ve sold more homes than we did last year.&nbsp;

Interest rates are also very low (high 2% to low 3% range), which helps the bottom line for your mortgage if you’re a buyer. 2020 has been crazy so far, but with the holidays coming up, we need to focus on what we can be thankful for. Regardless of what’s happened, we still have a lot to be thankful for in this country.&nbsp;

As always, we leave you with our quote of the week, and this one comes from none other than Mr. Rogers himself:

*“There are three ways to ultimate success. The first way is to be kind. The second way is to be kind. The third way is to be kind.”*&nbsp;

**Be thankful, and be kind to one another\!** If you have any real estate needs at all, don’t hesitate to give our office a call. We’d love to help you, and we wish you a happy Thanksgiving.

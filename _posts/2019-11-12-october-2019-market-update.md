**For your latest October market recap, I’ll compare all the key statistics with the same numbers from October 2018:**

* The number of home sales dropped from 1,549 to 1,489
* The average sales price rose from $215,043 to $232,064
* The average days on market rose from 49 to 55 days
* The absorption rate stayed the same: 2.95 months
* The number of active listings dropped from 4,465 to 4,364
* Interest rates dropped from 4.5% to 3.8%

That last statistic is especially good news for buyers considering most experts predicted that interest rates would increase. If you’re a buyer, there are plenty of great mortgage programs to take advantage of.

Now, for today’s quote:

*“Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection, we can catch excellence.”* - Vince Lombardi

As always, if you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

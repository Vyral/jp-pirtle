For my latest blog, I have great news to share from our Louisville real estate market: Things are popping, and my office has over 90 deals under contract\! **If you’re thinking of listing your home, don’t wait another minute—do it now.** As of the recording of today’s video, there were about 2,700 homes on the market. Five years ago, the average was 8,500. Inventory is low, and homes are selling quickly and for top dollar.&nbsp;

My team and I would love to give you a free market analysis and help you start off on the right foot if you’re ready to sell. Just give us a call or send an email.

Before I begin today’s topic, I want to make an announcement: We are now opening a brand-new office out in Mount Washington on Highway 44. We’re very excited about expanding our business and being able to serve more people in Bullitt, Odom, Nelson, Larue, Marion, and Hardin. Thank you all for your referrals and your business that has allowed us this growth.

Now, back to our topic: How does the market from June 2019 compare to that of June 2018? Let’s take a look.

• In 2019, we sold about 1,730 homes, whereas in 2018, we sold 1,751.
• The average sales price in June this year was $245,000, compared to the average of $234,000 in June 2018.
• The average days on market this year was 50 days, whereas it was 53 days last year.
• The absorption rate for this June was 2.76 months, and in June 2018, it was 2.7 months.
• This year, there were 4,074 active listings, which is a step down from last year’s 4,116 active listings.
• Our interest rates are currently hovering around 4%, which is a reduction from last year’s 4.5% rates. (These interest rates are compliments of Statewide Mortgage, a great company for all your refinancing needs)

If you have any questions about the numbers from our market or what they mean for your real estate goals, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you!

As a final note, I’ll leave you with my quote of the month from Big Willie: “Your attitude will always determine your altitude.”

In the world of real estate, it is crucial to stay on top of the current market trends and statistics. Today, we will be discussing the market summary for April 2022 versus April 2023. We will be comparing the number of homes sold, active listings, average sale price, and absorption rate.

Let's start with the number of homes sold in April of 2022 versus April of 2023. In April 2022, there were 1,618 homes sold, while in April 2023, there were 982 homes sold. This means there were over 600 more homes sold in April of last year than there were this year. However, **it is important to note that the real estate market has drastically changed since April 2022**, with the rise of interest rates and other factors contributing to the market's fluctuations.

Moving on, let's take a look at the number of active listings. In April of 2022, there were 1,696 active listings, while in April of 2023, there were 1,901 active listings. This means there was an increase of 205 more active listings this year than there were last year during April. Thus, there is more inventory this year than there was last year during April.

Now, let's examine the average sale price of a home. In April 2022, the average sale price was $296,000, while in April 2023, it was $304,000. This is an increase of $8,000 in the average sale price of a home.

Moving on to the absorption rate, which refers to how many homes are on the market and how long it would take to sell all of them. In April 2022, the absorption rate was 0.9, meaning it would take 27 days to sell all the homes on the market. However, in April 2023, the absorption rate was 1.4, which would come out to 42 days on the market. This is an increase of 15 more days on the market this year than last year, and it is also an observation of an increase in the inventory on the market.

Lastly, let's examine the average days on the market. In April of 2022, the average days on the market for homes were 25, while in April of 2023, it was 42 days. **This is an increase of 17 days on the market, which is a substantial increase.** Nevertheless, it is important to note that inventory is still low, and houses are only on the market for a few days longer.

Despite the fluctuations in the real estate market, it is essential to stay up-to-date on the current market trends and statistics. Steady interest rates between six and seven percent from lenders, coupled with low inventory in the greater local area, have resulted in great success in finding buyers their perfect homes, and sellers are continuously going under contract.

The real estate market is continually changing, and it is important to stay informed to make informed decisions. Whether you are buying or selling a home, the current market trends will always play a significant role in the process. So reach out to us by phone or email and find your dream home today.

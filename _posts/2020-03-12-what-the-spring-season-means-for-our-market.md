Spring has sprung, but what does that mean for our real estate market?&nbsp;

To start, **let’s look at the latest numbers from February and how they compare to February 2019:**

* The number of homes sold dropped from 1,091 to 1,051
* The average sales price rose from $217,000 to $220,000
* The average days on market rose from 100 to 104 days
* The absorption rates dropped from 2.44 months to 2.18 months
* The number of active listings dropped from 3,600 to 3,200
* Interest rates dropped from 4.37% to 3.5%

I don’t buy into the idea that you have to wait until a little later in the year to take advantage of the market. **Whether you’re buying or selling, you can take advantage of it now.**&nbsp;

If you’re a buyer, interest rates are absolutely unbelievable at the moment. If you’re a seller, there are a lot of serious buyers out there, and if you wait until April or May to list, you’ll have to compete against a lot more listings, so put your home on the market now and beat the competition.&nbsp;

Now for my quote of the day:&nbsp;

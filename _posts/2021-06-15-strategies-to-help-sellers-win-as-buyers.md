This real estate market keeps getting better and better for sellers. We’re coming around the other side of the pandemic and starting to see a bit more inventory out there. Homebuyers and sellers are optimistic, and now is the best time I’ve ever seen to sell a home. We have very low inventory and demand is sky-high. Between now and the end of the year, you’re going to see the best market you may ever see as a home seller.&nbsp;

Still, many are hesitant to sell because they’re not sure they’ll be able to find a new home. It’s a legitimate fear, and I get it. We have three specific strategies to help our clients sell without having the fear of not being able to find a new home:

**1\. Delayed closing.** You’re in total control of the situation as a seller. You don’t need to sign any contract with which you’re not comfortable. The average closing takes anywhere from 30 to 45 days. With a delayed closing, you can stay in the home for up to 90 days. This gives you three months to find and buy a new home, and I think that’s very doable in this market.

**2\. Purchase contingency.** For a lot of folks, we’re writing offers to say the sale is subject to the seller finding a new home. If you don’t find a new home, the contract is null and void. It’s that simple. Buyers are signing these agreements because they want to secure a home so badly.

**3\. Guaranteed offer.** This is a special program from Dream J.P. Pirtle Realtors. We can give you a guaranteed, as-is offer. There are no showings, repairs, inspections, lenders, etc. We give you a price, and you can take it or leave it. We can close whenever you want.

These are the three best strategies we have to overcome seller fears about buying in this market. Thank you all for your support over the past year, our team is so grateful. If you have any real estate needs or real estate-related questions at all, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Overall, the 2019 market was very similar to the market we saw in 2018:

**Homes Sold:**

* **2018:** 18,000
* **2019:** 17,900

**Average Sales Price:&nbsp;**

* **2018:** $219,000
* **2019:** $230,000

**Absorption Rate:**

* **2018:** 2.63 months
* **2019:** 2.69 months

**Number of Active Listings:**

* **2018:** 28,000
* **2019:** 28,000

**Interest Rates:**

* **2018:** 4.25%
* **2019:** 3.75 %

Now let’s take a look at what we can expect for 2020.

I believe that 2020 will be very similar to 2018 and 2019. Inventory should remain low, though a little more may come on yet this year. Rates will continue to be awesome—they’re actually still going down\!

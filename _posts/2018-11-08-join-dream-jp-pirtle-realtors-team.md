Our team is growing and we are hiring real estate agents. There are a few unique benefits to working on our team that you should know.

Thanks to your referrals and your business, we are growing tremendously. As a result, we are hiring new agents!

Whether you are currently an independent agent or looking to change teams, there are a few unique opportunities available on our team.

First of all, there’s the money. We can beat any legitimate competitor’s commissions. We can beat anyone’s commission splits and we have very low caps, which means that once we make a certain amount on your transactions, you will get 100% commissions. That is negotiable. We are not a large franchise but we can do deals that make sense so that we can beat anybody when it comes to money.

There are no royalty fees, monthly fees, desk fees, or technology fees when you work with us. We don’t charge our agents for signs, either. If you are going to market our company, those are free for you guys.

As far as income, we know how hard it is to get started in this business. Sometimes, there is a gap of a couple months where you really have to make money and people just go out of business. We have guaranteed income for the first few months so that you don’t just fall flat on your face. We realize that if you want to make a career change, you want to make some money.  

Our agents also benefit from the name recognition that comes with being part of Dream J.P. Pirtle Realtors. We spend almost $30,000 a month on marketing. We buy and sell 500 homes each year. We do a lot of business, which creates a lot of name recognition and a lot of leads for people to create business.

Speaking of leads, we generate 800 to 1,000 leads every month. I need good people who are not afraid to work these leads. We also offer a free lead management system that is probably the best one in the business. You get your own website but your lead management platform is free.

We also have a full-time admin staff ready to help you. We have a team leader, a lead manager, a listing manager who puts your listings on the MLS for you, and a closing manager who helps you get from contract to close.

We offer investment training. We buy or sell 50 to 70 investment properties a year. For a lot of people, real estate is a great way to produce retirement income. I’ve been doing that for 20 years, and when you join my company, anything that I know is for you to know. I will be an open book for you. I can help you buy flips, rentals, or anything else you’re interested in.

So, what are we looking for in a candidate?

We are looking for ambitious, honest, hardworking people who believe in treating other people the way they want to be treated. That’s how we like to do business. We have almost 60 agents but our team has a small, family atmosphere.

We are looking for agents who want to grow with us, have fun, have a great life, and treat others the way they want to be treated.

If you or anyone you know is interested in working with us, contact me or John Holtzinger at (502) 458-2722 or JohnH@JPPirtle.com. We look forward to hearing from you!

Do you want a new career where the amount of work you put in is equal to your results? Do you have your license already but are frustrated because you're not reaching your real estate goals? We're hiring and looking for hard-working, ambitious people. Here are the reasons why our company might be the right fit for you:

**1\. Leads.** They’re the lifeblood of any real estate business, and we have so many that we cannot handle them all. You’ll have new leads dropping into your inbox every day.

**2\. Training.** When you come to our company, you’ll get one-on-one training from our entire staff, including a lead manager, listing manager, and marketing manager. You'll also have a team leader as a mentor.&nbsp;

**3\. Marketing.** We spend approximately $300,000 per year marketing our listings and company. That creates a lot of name recognition, which will help you get results. When you're on our team, we pay for all the marketing.

**4\. No fees.** We don't charge you any fees, which means more money in your pocket.

**5\. Commission splits.** Our commission splits are better than anybody else in the business.

Our goal is for you to succeed because when you succeed, we succeed.

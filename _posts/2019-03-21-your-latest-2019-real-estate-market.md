The latest numbers are in for February’s real estate market, so today we’ll be comparing our 2019 stats with those of 2018. Things are looking good, but let’s put a magnifying glass on the metrics:
• There were 1,166 homes sold in February 2018 and 1,055 sold in February 2019.
• The average sales price was $204,500 in February 2018 and $216,500 in February 2019.
• The average days on market was 69 in February 2018 and 71 in February 2019.
• There was 2.26 months’ worth of inventory in February 2018 and 2.41 months’ worth in February 2019.
• There were 3,449 active listings in February 2018 and 3,601 in 2019.

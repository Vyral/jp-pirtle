Our team recently met with someone who was tasked with selling his mother’s gorgeous Alta Avenue property. This client’s mother lived in this home until she was 105, and one look at this property makes it clear why someone would want to stay here for decades on end. Aside from its character and charm, this beautiful house is also situated in a great neighborhood. Ultimately, our client decided that rather than listing the property on the open market, he wanted to sell it to us as-is for cash. Now, it’s in our hands—and though it’s going to be hard to let it go, we wanted you to be the first to know that it will be available to purchase very soon. If you have any interest in this property, please don’t hesitate to let us know. And, as a final note, our team has recently expanded our horizons. We’re now happy to serve buyers and sellers in Bullitt, Otoe, Shelby, Nelson, Marian, and Larue Counties, in addition to the markets we already serve. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

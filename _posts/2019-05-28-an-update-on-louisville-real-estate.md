As we head into the summer, I wanted to bring you a quick update on the Louisville real estate market. Here’s what you need to know.

As we head into the summer, I wanted to bring you some of the latest numbers from the Louisville real estate market in April and compare them to what we saw at this time last year.
• Here are some of the statistics I’ve been keeping my eye on:
• Home sales are down from 1,583 to 1,442
• Our average sale price is up to $223,000 from $220,000
• The average days on market stayed relatively flat, going up slightly to 64 from 62
• The absorption rate sits at 2.48 months, which is up from the 2.33 months we saw last year
• Active listings are low, but they’re slowly creeping up. They sit at 3,687 currently, which is up from 3,554 last year
• The average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage has dropped back below 5% and now sits at 4.5%

Thanks to my great friends at Statewide Mortgage for providing me with the interest rate update.

Last but not least, it’s time for our monthly quote. This month’s quote is:

“If we ever forget that we are one nation under God, then we will be a nation gone under.” -Ronald Reagan.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime or need any real estate help at all, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

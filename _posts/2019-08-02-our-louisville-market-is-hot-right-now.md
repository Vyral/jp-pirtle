Today I’m in the Highlands section of Louisville right off of Norris Avenue to show off a great home my team and I just bought and share a quick message about our market. The owner of this home wanted to sell quickly and for top dollar, so we gave her two options: We could either list it on the conventional market or buy it from her as-is in cash. She chose the second option, and now we’re planning on putting it on the market ourselves or renting it out. If you’re a buyer, you have to know about these houses as soon as they’re available, because our market is hot right now. We just opened a brand-new office, so whether you’re a buyer or a seller, we’d love to help you reach your real estate goals. To hear my full message, watch this short video.

Are you wondering how the real estate market changed over the last year? June 2024 brough some interesting shifts in median prices, sales, and inventory levels. As a sales manager and an associate broker, I'm here to give you a quick market recap for June 2024 compared to June 2023. **Here are the stats you need to know based on our current market:**

Median Sales Price:

* June 2024: $285,000
* June 2023: $275,000
* Increase: $10,000 (3.64%)

Average Days on Market:

* June 2024: 7 days
* June 2023: 6 days
* Trend: Slight increase but still a quick market

Absorption Rate:

* June 2024: 2.11 months
* June 2023: 1.49 months
* Interpretation: It would take just over two months to sell all current inventory, indicating a healthy market.

Interest Rates:

* Fluctuating between mid-6% to just over 7%, influenced by various factors like credit scores, down payments, and loan programs.

The increase in both median list and sales prices indicates a robust market where property values are rising, which is great news for sellers. The quick turnaround in average days on market shows that well-priced homes are still selling fast, typically within the first week. The absorption rate suggests a balanced inventory, neither too high nor too low.

If you're considering selling your home, now is a good time, given the rising prices and quick sales. For buyers, the market is competitive, but real estate remains a solid investment, especially with appreciating values.

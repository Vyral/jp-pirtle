If you’re considering selling your home in the near future, how seriously are you thinking about staging? In the real estate industry, it’s widely accepted by experts across different fields that staging nets you more money for your sale, but I’ve spoken to a lot of homeowners who see it as a waste of time and money. If you’re on the fence about staging, here’s the truth: A few thousand dollars upfront can get you a two-to-one return on your investment and save you tons of time in the long run, which is why I always recommend sellers stage their properties. Here are the three most important benefits of staging you don’t want to throw away:

**1\. Staging minimizes issues and highlights features.** No home is 100% perfect, but staging allows you to move the focus away from your flaws and toward your strengths. Small rooms, dated appliances, and old fixtures can all be mitigated by proper staging. Items that would normally be sticking points at negotiations might be looked over by buyers who are attracted to your property’s highlighted features, so if you want a smooth home sale, I highly recommend staging.

**2\. Staging turns your home into a shopping experience.** Have you ever visited a model home? If you have, you know they have a clean, neutral feel that encourages you to look at the property as a product instead of as a messy place where life happens. Your home probably has some unique personality traits that could be a turn-off for certain buyers. By depersonalizing your home with staging, you can avoid these issues and present your home as a blank slate buyers can project their desires on to.

**3\. The data proves staging nets you a great return on investment.** There’s a reason why all home experts recommend staging; [according to one estimate](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/moving/home-staging-statistics#:~:text=Home%20Staging%20ROI&amp;text=About%2075%25%20of%20sellers%20see,put%20them%20up%20for%20sale.&amp;text=Investing%201.3%25%20in%20staging%20results,according%20to%20a%202021%20survey), putting 1.3% of your sale price into staging can net you an extra 7.1% on your final offer. I know it’s tough to have extra cash lying around when you’re planning a move, but I highly recommend accounting a few extra thousand dollars for staging costs when you prepare to sell your house. Not only will you see a great return, but your home will sell faster and attract more buyers.

Today, I'm here to provide you with insights into how the real estate market has been faring this year when compared to July of the previous year. Let's delve into key statistics that shed light on these market dynamics.

We kick off by examining the absorption rate, a crucial metric that reflects how long it would take to exhaust the existing inventory if no new listings were added. July of this year has witnessed a slight increase, indicating a month and a half's time to deplete available listings. In contrast, July of the previous year saw a quicker rate, requiring less than a month and a half. **This change represents a 14% shift, pointing towards evolving market conditions.**

Moving on to average list prices, this year's data showcases an average listing price of just over $408,000. Comparatively, the numbers from last year indicated an average of slightly over $392,000. This indicates a marginal increase of around 4%, underlining shifting price dynamics.

The average sale price is another crucial indicator of market trends. This year, the average sale price reached a little over $330,000, while the previous year's average was a little over $308,000. This indicates a more substantial change, with a 7% increase in average sale prices.

Days on market, a metric that reflects how long properties typically stay listed before being sold, reveals an interesting contrast. This year's data shows properties spending an average of 28 days on the market. Comparatively, properties in the same month of the previous year were on the market for an average of 22 days. This shift demonstrates a 27% increase in the time properties spend on the market, reflecting changing buyer behavior.

**It's essential to factor in interest rates, as they play a significant role in the real estate landscape.** While current rates are influenced by various loan types, the average stands at 6.8% to 7.5%. Remember, this can vary based on the specific loan type you opt for.

The real estate market is ever-evolving, showcasing both subtle and significant changes within a year's span. As the market dynamics transform, it's crucial to stay informed and adapt accordingly.

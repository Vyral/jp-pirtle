If you want to buy and sell a home at the same time, you need a skilled, experienced real estate team behind you.

If you need to buy and sell a home at the same time, that’s a tricky prospect in our current market.

Several years ago, we agents could coordinate these two transactions much more easily. Now, things have changed. Two or three years ago, inventory in our market started to shrink. Before that time, we had as much as 15,000 available homes on the market. Now, we have a little over 3,000.

In other words, we’re still in a strong seller’s market, which means you need an aggressive, strategic marketing program to get your current home sold quickly. If you work with our team, that shouldn’t be a problem.

The real question, though, is what you’re going to do with your next home. Are you upsizing or downsizing? In either case, you need the services of an experienced team with the tools that can help you locate the right home, make an offer on it, and get it under contract before any other buyers know about it. Once a home goes live in this market, it’s a challenge to get to it before anyone else.

As far as experience goes, the agent you work with should be a full-time Realtor and be a part of a team that sells roughly 500 homes a year. If you give us a call, we’d be happy to give you a market evaluation and tell you how we can get you to the closing table on both sides of the transaction with the least amount of hassle.

If you have any other questions about our market, feel free to reach out to us as well. We’d love to help you.

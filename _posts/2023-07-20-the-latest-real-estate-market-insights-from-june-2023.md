The **absorption rate** is a crucial indicator of market stability, measuring the rate at which available properties are sold within a specific time frame. In June 2023, the absorption rate stood at 1.51, marking a notable increase from the previous year's figure of 1.21. This signifies a 24% difference, indicating a stronger and more active market.

The **average list price** is an important metric that reveals the general pricing trends in the real estate market. In June 2023, the average list price reached $413,269, experiencing a 4.33% increase compared to June 2022 when it was $396,104. This demonstrates a steady appreciation in property values over the past year.

The **median list price** provides a snapshot of the midpoint value of all listed properties in a given period. In June 2023, the median list price surged to $317,950, marking a significant increase of 15.62% from the previous year's figure of $275,000. This spike indicates a robust demand for properties and a potentially competitive market.

Examining the **average sale price** further illustrates the changing dynamics of the real estate market. In June 2023, the average sale price stood at $334,689, showcasing a noteworthy 7.76% increase from June 2022's figure of $310,573. This rise reflects the growing value of properties and the potential for favorable returns on investment.

The **average days on market** serves as a key measure of buyer activity and property turnover. This year, properties have spent an average of 31 days on the market, indicating a slightly longer time for sales compared to the previous year when the average was 22 days. This change suggests a potential adjustment in buyer behavior and market dynamics.

Currently, **interest rates** hover around the high 6% range, which can influence affordability and mortgage options.

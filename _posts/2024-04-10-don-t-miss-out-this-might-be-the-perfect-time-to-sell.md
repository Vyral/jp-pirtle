Have you thought about selling your property? If you’re considering selling your home, now might just be the perfect time to do so. Homes are flying off the market at top dollar, and it would be a waste to let this moment pass, especially if you’ve been on the fence about selling your property. There are two main options for selling your house:

**1\. Take an all-cash, as-is offer.** This option lets you sell your house quickly without any hassle. You don’t have to worry about negotiations, inspections, or appraisals. It’s a matter of taking what you want from the house and leaving the rest to the buyer's kind of situation. Plus, you can also close the deal as fast as you need, whether it’s in a week or a few months.

**2\. List your house on the market.** If you prefer this option better, then my team and I can help you as well. We are going to give you a valuation of your house on the open market. However, the real estate market is currently experiencing low inventory levels. This means there are more buyers than available homes, which can drive up prices.

Speaking of prices, here are some numbers about the current market trend. **The median list price for homes has increased from $295,000 to $320,000 compared to last year.** Additionally, the median sales price has gone up from $250,000 to $265,000. This shows a significant increase in home prices over the past year.

Homes are selling fast, with **median days on the market being just 15 days.** This means that, on average, it takes only two weeks to sell a house in today’s market conditions. Lastly, mortgage rates remain relatively steady, with rates for FHA or conventional loans ranging from the low sixes to the low sevens.

So, if you’re considering selling your house, don’t hesitate to reach out to me and my team at JP Pirtle Real Estate. You can call us or send us an email, and with our expertise and guidance, you can navigate the real estate market with confidence.

As we delve into the intricacies of the real estate market, a comparison between January 2023 and January 2024 reveals insightful trends for homeowners, buyers, and investors alike. Understanding these shifts can guide us in making informed decisions in the ever-evolving housing landscape.

January 2024 witnessed a slight decrease in home sales, with 718 homes sold compared to 859 in January 2023. However, the market's resilience is underscored by the rising average sales price, from $270,020 in 2023 to $295,020 in 2024. This increase signifies a growing interest in equity, emphasizing the value of entering the market sooner rather than later.

Homes are moving faster, with the average days on the market dropping from 50 in 2023 to 45 in 2024. **This acceleration indicates a competitive market where listings quickly transition from "for sale" to "sold," reflecting the high demand among prospective buyers.**

Active home listings saw a rise in 2024, with 2,372 homes available, up from 2,035 in 2023. Conversely, new listings dipped slightly to 1,347 in 2024 from 1,404 the previous year. The absorption rate has adjusted accordingly, shifting from one-and-a-half months in 2023 to just under two months in 2024, presenting a nuanced view of market availability.

**The current interest rate hovers around 6%, offering a window of opportunity for potential buyers.** Thanks to partnerships with trusted local lenders like Statewide Mortgage, rates as competitive as 5.99% are accessible, underscoring the importance of seeking out favorable mortgage conditions.

The real estate market continues to evolve, with price increases and faster sales highlighting the need for timely action.

The owners of the house at **3306 Bon Air Avenue** came to own the property by way of inheritance, and they decided that they wanted to sell it with us. As always, we gave them several options on how to proceed.

One option was to put it on the market and list it for retail dollars; the other option was to sell it to us, as is, for cash.

They felt really good about the second option, so **they accepted our cash offer.**

I love this little property. Approximately 1,000 square feet, it’s a unique, 2-bed, 2-bath home with a basement. We’re not yet sure if we’re going to rent or sell it, but we’ll be putting it on the market very soon. **The weather is still hot, and the market is still hot, too.**

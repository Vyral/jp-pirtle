Today we’re sharing a real estate market comparison for May 2019 versus May 2020:

* **Homes sold:** 1,757 \| 1,292
* **Average sales price:** $236,000 \| $245,000
* **Average days on market**\: 57 \| 57
* **New listings:** 2,571 \| 2,001
* **Absorption rate**\: 2.62 months \| 2.5 months\*
* **Interest rate**\: 4.63% \| 3.23%

\*Remember, the absorption rate is how long it would take to sell all current housing inventory.&nbsp;

Even though we sold fewer homes and had fewer new listings due to the pandemic in May 2020, **home values increased and interest rates are lower.**&nbsp;

We want to recommend Statewide Mortgage. They’re a wonderful company, whether you’re buying a house or refinancing, they’re local and great at what they do. Give them a call if you have mortgage needs at (502) 585-5626.&nbsp;

We also want to share a Bible verse with you: “Do to others as you would have them do to you.” - Luke 6:31

Real estate can be an amazing career for the right person. That said, we’ve got some great news: Our team is hiring.

Whether you’ve got your license and have experience under your belt already or you’re just now thinking of entering the industry, we’d love to connect with you to discuss your future.

Our team spends about $300,000 on advertising each year, and this creates a lot of leads. That’s exactly why we’re looking for hardworking, career-oriented people right now. We need agents to work the surplus of leads we have.

Our commission program, team commission splits, and independent commission splits are as good as it gets. Better yet, there are no fees for our agents. We offer signage, technology, and other resources you need to do the best job for our clients. This helps to put more money in your pocket.

In addition, agents on our team can draw upon the support of our full-time administrative staff and various managers—all of whom are there to help lift you up to your full potential.

Not everyone feels certain that a real estate career is right for them, though. Many worry that they’ll spend a lot of time spinning their wheels, trying to get that first deal under their belt. When you join us, you can let go of those fears. Our 12-week guaranteed income program will make sure that you hit the ground running and start earning right away.

So if you or anyone you know are looking to get into real estate, please give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

testimonial:
  - quote: "J.P’s aggressive marketing plan and enthusiasm is what “sold” us on his company. We sensed that he would do whatever it took to put a SOLD sign on our home. He communicated with us frequently and offered helpful suggestions for making our home more attractive to potential buyers. J.P’s aggressiveness, honesty and knowledge of the current market resulted in frequent showings and multiple offers. He was available whenever we needed to discuss the offers- even meeting us at the airport and writing on the hood of his car! I have to also mention Susan and Shannon they were great TEAM PLAYERS and we think they were super to work with too! Thanks JP!"

They did a great job gathering information and informing us of what was going on. We appreciate their willingness to take calls on weekends and during non business hours. Their performance was outstanding. I would use this agent again and refer him to others! Thanks JP!"
